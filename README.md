# Linear Regression: Salary vs Experience

This project demonstrates a simple Linear Regression model using Python and scikit-learn to predict salary based on years of experience.

## 📊 Project Overview

- **Goal**: Predict salary using years of experience as the independent variable.
- **Model**: Simple Linear Regression
- **Libraries Used**:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `scikit-learn`

## 📁 Files

- `salary_data.csv`: Dataset containing `YearsExperience` and `Salary`.
- `linear_regression.py`: Python script that trains the model, predicts, and visualizes results.
- `README.md`: Project documentation (this file).

## 🧠 How the Model Works

1. Data is loaded and split into training and test sets.
2. A linear regression model is trained on 80% of the data.
3. The model is evaluated and visualized using both training and test data.
4. Scatter plots and regression lines are used to visualize performance.

## 📈 Visualizations

- **Training Set**: Red dots (actual data), blue line (regression fit).
